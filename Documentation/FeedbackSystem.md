# Feedback and System Patterns in Combine

## When to Use Feedback and System Patterns

### Good Use Cases for Feedback and System Patterns:

1. **Managing Stateful Logic:** These patterns excel in scenarios where the system's state changes in response to various events. They simplify state management by decomposing it into a series of state transformations in response to actions.
2. **Complex User Interactions:** Applications with complex user interfaces and interactions can benefit from these patterns, as they can manage the state transitions in a predictable and organized manner.
3. **Reactive Systems:** For systems that need to react to various events and maintain state consistency across different parts of the application, the Feedback and System patterns provide a structured approach to propagate changes through the system.
4. **Decoupling Components:** They help in achieving a decoupled architecture by isolating side effects from the state and action handling logic, which leads to a more maintainable and testable codebase.

## When Not to Use Feedback and System Patterns

### Not Good Use Cases for Feedback and System Patterns:

1. **Simple State Management:** In cases where state management is straightforward and does not involve complex state transitions or side effects, using these patterns could be over-engineering.
2. **One-off Events:** For handling events that occur once or follow a simple flow, traditional completion blocks or delegation may be more appropriate and less complex.
3. **Learning Curve:** If the development team is not well-versed in reactive programming concepts, these patterns might introduce unnecessary complexity and can have a steep learning curve.
4. **Performance Considerations:** In performance-sensitive parts of the code, the overhead introduced by reactive programming and the use of these patterns might not be justified.

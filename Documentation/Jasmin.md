# Jasmine

##Good Use Cases for Jasmine

1. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Ideal for teams practicing BDD and needing a framework aligned with this approach.
2. **Testing JavaScript**: Well-suited for JavaScript projects, including handling of asynchronous operations.
3. **Unit Testing**: Excellent for writing well-organized unit tests with a variety of assertion types.
4. **Readable Syntax**: Beneficial for those who value test cases that are easy to read and write.
5. **No DOM Dependency**: Can run tests in a JavaScript runtime without a browser, which is great for CI/CD pipelines.
6. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Fits well into TDD workflows, where tests guide the development process.

##When Not to Use Jasmine

1. **Integration with Other Systems**: Not the best choice when extensive integration with other systems is required without additional tools.
2. **Performance Overhead**: Might not be ideal for large-scale projects where the overhead from a testing framework is a concern.
3. **End-to-End Testing**: While possible, there are other tools specifically designed for end-to-end testing that might be preferable.
4. **Advanced Mocking Needs**: If advanced mocking capabilities are required, integrating with other libraries or choosing a different framework might be necessary.

# Jasmine (Quick and Nimble)

## Quick is a behavior-driven development framework for Swift and Objective-C, which, along with its matcher framework Nimble, provides a way to write clear and expressive tests. Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code, and it uses a similar syntax and structure to Quick/Nimble, focusing on readable test descriptions and expectations.

## Good uses:

- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Ideal for teams practicing BDD and needing a framework aligned with this approach.
- **Testing**: Well-suited for projects, including handling of asynchronous operations.
- **Unit Testing**: Excellent for writing well-organized unit tests with a variety of assertion types.
- **Readable Syntax**: Beneficial for those who value test cases that are easy to read and write.
- **No DOM Dependency**: Can run tests in a JavaScript runtime without a browser, which is great for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Fits well into TDD workflows, where tests guide the development process.

## Less ideal uses:

- **Integration with Other Systems**: Not the best choice when extensive integration with other systems is required without additional tools.
- **Performance Overhead**: Might not be ideal for large-scale projects where the overhead from a testing framework is a concern.
- **End-to-End Testing**: While possible, there are other tools specifically designed for end-to-end testing that might be preferable.
- **Advanced Mocking Needs**: If advanced mocking capabilities are required, integrating with other libraries or choosing a different framework might be necessary.

## Implementing Quick and Nimble for Unit Testing

Quick and Nimble are popular unit testing frameworks for Swift that provide a behavior-driven development (BDD) style of writing tests. Here is an overview of how to use them:

### Test Class Setup

- Import Quick and Nimble modules
- Create a test class that inherits from QuickSpec
- Add any shared variables, mocks, etc at the top level of the class

```swift
import Quick
import Nimble

class MovieListServiceSpec: QuickSpec {

  // shared variables, mocks, etc

}
```

### Describe Test Suites

Use describe blocks to define high-level test suites. These are usually structured to describe the component under test.

```swift
override func spec() {

  describe("Movie list service") {

    // tests

  }

}
```

### Contexts and Before Each

Use `context` blocks to set up different contexts for tests. Use `beforeEach` to configure common setup before each test.

```swift
context("when successful response") {
  beforeEach {
    // common setup 
  }

  // tests
}
```
  
### Writing Test Cases

In Swift, we use `it` blocks to define individual test cases. Nimble matchers like `expect(â€¦).to()` are used to assert expected outcomes.

Here is an example:

```swift
it("should return correct movies") {
  let result = // call service  
  expect(result).to(equal(expectedMovies)) 
}
```

Please review and use this code carefully.

### Executing Tests
Xcode will find and run tests automatically. You can also run tests via CLI with xcodebuild test. This allows writing clean and readable unit tests in a BDD style.
